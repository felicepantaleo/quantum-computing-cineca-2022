    "## Measurable quantities\n",
    "\n",
    "here we report all the quantities that can be measured at the end of a simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measures\n",
    "\n",
    "With measures we denote the projective measurements performed at the end of a simulation.\n",
    "We perform *nshots* such measurements. These quantity can be accessed from the\n",
    ":py:func:`simulation_results.measures`. The format of the measurement is a dictionary,\n",
    "where the keys are the measured states and the values the number of times that state has\n",
    "been measured. The format of the state is conditioned by the *local_dim* of the degrees of freedom:\n",
    "\n",
    "* if *local_dim*=2, then the single-site states are not separated by a comma, i.e.\n",
    "    a state measured in |000> will have a key `'000'`;\n",
    "* if *local_dim*>2, then the single-site states **are** separated by a comma, i.e.\n",
    "    a state measured in |000> will have a key `'0,0,0'`. This is to ensure that the\n",
    "    result stays readable even if the measured state is $\\geq 10$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We use the same notation of qiskit, which is opposite to the usual notation used in theory**.\n",
    "This means that the sites are not reported as $|s_1s_2\\dots s_n\\rangle$,\n",
    "but as $|s_ns_{n-1}\\dots s_1\\rangle$, to be consistent with the common notation\n",
    "in bitstrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "res = run_simulation(GHZ_qc, bond_dim=4, nshots=1024)\n",
    "measures = res.measure\n",
    "for key in measures.keys():\n",
    "    print(key, ': ', str( measures[key] ) )\n",

    ">>> '111' : 514\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "### Statevector\n",
    "\n",
    "The statevector returns the full statevector of the system with $2^n$ elements.\n",
    "It SHOULD NOT be addressed when the number of sites is $n\\geq 30$, and it is\n",
    "enabled by the *do_statevector* parameter. It is nevertheless useful for comparison\n",
    "and testing when the number of sites is small.\n",
    "It can be addressed using `simulation_results.statevector`. Notice that,\n",
    "as stated in the prievous section, the notation is different from the one commonly\n",
    "used in theory, and so also the coefficients of the vector are not the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computational time\n",
    "\n",
    "It is simply the time taken by the evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Singular values cut\n",
    "\n",
    "The singular values cut are an indication of the approximation taking place during the\n",
    "simulation. Indeed, at each application of two-qubit there is an approximation going on,\n",
    "subject to the *bond_dim* $\\chi$ and the *cut_ratio* $\\epsilon$ parameters.\n",
    "Based on the *singval_mode* the singular values are reported:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *singval_mode=M*, at each two-site operator we save the maximum of the singular values cut\n",
    "* *singval_mode=C*, at each two-site operator we save the **sum** of the singular values cut\n",
    "\n",
    "We recall that, given a decreasing-ordered vector of singular values\n",
    "$S=(s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_n)$ we truncate all the singular values:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "s_i \\; \\mbox{ is truncated }\\quad \\mbox{if} \\; i>\\chi \\; \\mbox{ or } \\;\n",
    "\\frac{s_i}{s_1}<\\epsilon\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entanglement\n",
    "\n",
    "The bond entanglement entropy across each bond at the end of the simulation. It is\n",
    "a $n-1$ dimensional vector of non-negative values, defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    S_V= - \\sum_{i=1}^\\chi s_i^2 \\log(s_i^2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### MPS state and file size\n",
    "\n",
    "The MPS structure with row-major tensors, to be used in python for further analysis\n",
    "or as an input state for following simulations. It is available only if the parameter\n",
    "*save_mps* is set to `F`. We also provide the file size of the MPS state, to have\n",
    "a measure of how big is the MPS. This size is available when *save_mps* is `F` or `U`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observables measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "The observables measured at the end of the simulation, formatted as dict. The keys\n",
    "are the observables name, while the value their measurements. For further information\n",
    "see the :doc:`chapters/observables` page.\n"
