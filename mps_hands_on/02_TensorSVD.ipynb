    "# Implement the SVD on a tensor\n",
    "\n",
    "We have discussed a lot all the operations available on tensors. They are important, but if you don't use them you don't really understand them. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is now your turn of implementing the SVD as in the figure below!\n",
    "Once you finish you can run the check_svd function, to see if you actually did it correctly!\n",

    "There are also some small tips, but use them ONLY if you need them. It is far better to discuss in the chat, even privately with the other partecipants.\n",

    "- `np.tensordot`: computes the tensor contraction of two tensors along given legs [docs](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.tensordot.html)\n",

    "- `np.transpose`: transpose legs [docs](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.transpose.html?highlight=transpose#numpy.transpose)\n",
